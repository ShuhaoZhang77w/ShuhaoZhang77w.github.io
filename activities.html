                    (24-28 Nov. 2024) I attended the conference <em>2024 IEEE Information Theory Workshop, Shenzhen, China</em>, and gave the talk <b><em>On Verifying Entropic Vectors with Distributions Generated by Neural Networks</em></b>.
                    During the conference, I had an in-depth discussion with Prof. Qi Chen (Xidian University, China), where our work was recognized and appreciated.
